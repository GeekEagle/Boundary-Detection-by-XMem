Boundary-Detection-by-XMem 

This work report is on https://www.researchgate.net/publication/392598018_Boundary_Detection_on_Edge_Device_with_Video_Object_Segmentation

We use f-BRS to initialize the target objects on the first frame, and use XMem to track the subsequent frames. We test this system on our laptops. We combine the f-BRS, XMem, and our designed boundary detection algorithm to implement the real-time video object segmentation with boundary detection on edge device. This is a demo code. The workplace folder contains some initialized video frames, and the demo starts from the main.py
